# Clawsome: Animal & Pet Blog Project Outline (Using Free Resources)
Project Name: Clawsome
Theme: Animals & Pets (Family-Friendly)
Project Needs:
We're excited to be building an animal and pet blog called Clawsome! Since the client wants to keep things budget-friendly, we'll be focusing on using free resources for website creation and content development. Here's what we'll need to consider:
Free Resources:
Website Builder: We'll need to research and choose a user-friendly platform like Wix, WordPress.com (with limitations), or Blogger. It's important to keep in mind the limitations of free plans when making this choice.
Stock Photos & Videos: Luckily, there are great free resources available like Pexels and Unsplash for high-quality images. Pixabay even offers some free video options, which could be a nice bonus.
SEO Tools: To help with search engine optimization (SEO), we'll explore free options like Ubersuggest or the limited features of Google Keyword Planner.
Social Media Management: Hootsuite also has a limited free plan that can help manage our social media presence initially.

Engaging Content: The key here is creating informative and entertaining content about animals and pets that's suitable for all ages. We'll focus on a variety of formats to keep things interesting:
Articles: In-depth explorations of specific animal breeds, care guides, training tips, or fascinating animal facts.
Lists: Fun listicles like "Top 10 Funniest Cat Videos" or helpful ones like "Easy DIY Pet Enrichment Activities" and "Must-Have Travel Essentials for Your Dog."
Infographics: Eye-catching infographics that visually represent pet health statistics, breed comparisons, or historical timelines related to animals.
DIY Projects: Simple crafts or activities that pet owners can do with their furry friends, like homemade cat toys or dog treat recipes.

User-Friendly Design: The website needs to be easy to navigate and visually appealing for a broad audience. Here's what we'll keep in mind:
Responsive Design: The website should adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktop, mobile, tablet) for an optimal user experience.
Clear Navigation: A clear and intuitive navigation menu is crucial so users can easily find the content they're looking for.
High-Quality Images & Videos (Within Free Resources): Even though we're using free resources, prioritizing high-quality visuals is important to keep users engaged.
Goals and Objectives:
Our main goals for Clawsome are to:
Inform: Educate readers about various animals and pets, promoting responsible pet ownership and a deeper appreciation for the animal kingdom. We'll want to target specific knowledge gaps and misconceptions about pet care while catering to different age groups with varying levels of complexity in the content.
Entertain: Provide fun and engaging content for pet lovers, creating a space for relaxation and enjoyment. This could involve heartwarming stories of animal rescues, heroic pets, or special bonds between humans and animals. Featuring funny pet content like videos or comics can also bring a smile to readers' faces.
Build Community (Optional - Limited with Free Resources): While building a robust community might be limited with free website builders, we can still explore options like: 
Enabling Comments: Allowing readers to leave comments on articles fosters discussions and sharing of experiences.
Integrating Social Media: Utilizing social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram can help connect with a wider audience, share blog content, and host discussions.
Development Life Cycle:
Planning:
First, we need to define the target audience (e.g., pet owners, animal enthusiasts, families with pets).
Then, we'll develop a content calendar outlining topics, formats (articles, lists, infographics), and posting frequency.
Researching and choosing a free website builder platform with user-friendly features and customization options (considering limitations of free plans) is crucial.
Finally, we'll identify relevant keywords related to animals and pets for improved search engine visibility using free SEO tools.
Analysis:
Analyzing popular keywords and search terms related to animals and pets will help optimize content.
Researching existing animal and pet blogs will help identify content gaps and potential areas where Clawsome can stand out.
If using free templates, we'll need to assess existing content (if any) for relevance and potential repurposing.
